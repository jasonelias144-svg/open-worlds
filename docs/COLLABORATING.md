# Building on this: start here

For anyone building on open-worlds, and in particular for the founder's
conversations with DeepSeek. This is the page to start from. The
founder: "What you put in the repo becomes the new standard we develop
from in my DeepSeek conversations."

The multiverse began as a sketch the founder wrote with DeepSeek
(conversation records 012-04-00 and 012-03-02). This repository brought
it in, made it run, and changed what needed changing; what was kept and
what changed, and why, is in [MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md) and in each
module's docstring.

## Two sides: the sketch and the standard

**The sketch is a rough draft.** Each step in the conversation assumes the
last one ran as expected and asks what to build next, the way a creative
team might convey a vision in code instead of boxes and arrows. Nobody
expects it to run, and bugs are part of a draft. In the founder's words
(to the technical lead, 2026-11-13): "it is meant to be a starting point
for you, not an end point." So an
"Expected output" in the conversation is a prediction, which is fine; the
house rules below apply when code comes into open-worlds itself.

**The records and the sketch's code are kept, apart.** They live in
[`sketches/`](../sketches/README.md): the conversation records verbatim,
and DeepSeek's code written out exactly as the record has it, with every
test's result. That is a record of DeepSeek's suggestions, kept so they
can be read, run and debugged, without committing to using them.
[`sketches/INDEX.md`](../sketches/INDEX.md) is the one place that says
where the sketch and the course meet: each component, how its tests fare,
which course step it relates to, and whether any of it is in open-worlds.

**The standard is open-worlds' own code, not the sketches.** Build on
`multiverse/` and the documents in `docs/`. The code in `sketches/` is
earlier work, some of it on the old, unsigned protocol, kept for its
ideas.

## Where the conversation stands

Record 012-04-00 now runs to component 43, and ends with the founder's
question about a council: a small group that decides for the whole. Each
component's place is in [`sketches/INDEX.md`](../sketches/INDEX.md). In
short: components 1 to 7 are in `multiverse/`, working (course step 1);
13 and 14, signatures and their conformance test, were rebuilt in step 2,
where an identity is its key; 15, signed passports, is course step 3,
next.

Since the sketch, the founder has added ideas that now shape the
course: learning agents in the chemistry world whose intelligence grows
with the complexity of the molecules, evolution as a path between worlds,
accelerated time, and one day a main community world
([MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md)). Then, in components 36 to 43: identity
across worlds (a person above their world-level identities, lineage,
forks and merges), and architectures for many models across worlds (the
octopus, the nervous system, the swarm, and next the council), with the
founder's aim for the infrastructure: "we just need to create
infrastructure that can handle what we cannot imagine yet."

## What the last stretch taught

Four lessons from components 21 to 43, for when these ideas are built
here. They are about the design, not about bugs in the draft.

1. **Anything that says something about someone needs that someone's
   signature.** In the draft, a parent can name a child without the
   child agreeing, and a third party can withdraw someone else's witness.
   In open-worlds, nobody else can make you leave, and the same should
   hold for claims about you.
2. **A self spread across worlds needs each part linked to it, with both
   signing.** The person signs "this identity is mine" and the identity
   signs "I belong to this person". That link is what makes the arms of
   the octopus one creature's arms.
3. **A person's list of identities should be a chain, like a world's
   log,** each version naming the one before, so that dropping an
   identity shows.
4. **What a part produced belongs in what it signs,** so the record shows
   what it did, not only that it reported.

## What would help most now

The code standard is kept here, step by step. The most useful
contributions now are creative and design work for the steps ahead, as
text or as code with tests:

- **Laws for new worlds.** The organic chemistry world (course step 8):
  what it admits by, what can happen in it, what counts as solving a
  problem there.
- **Problems for the learner** (course step 6): standing problems in the
  chemistry world, from easy to hard, each checkable by the chemistry
  itself.
- **Forms for the poetry world.** For example, a world whose law asks
  each turn to add a quatrain in common meter, Dickinson's meter.
- **Anything on the course,** proposed as described below.

## The standard

- **The code in `multiverse/`, at a named commit.** Whatever is merged
  into `main` is the current standard; a proposal names the commit it
  built on.
- **The protocol, WCP/0.2** (`multiverse/protocol.py`): manifest,
  petition, act, leave, log. An individual is a key, and every request
  is signed (`multiverse/identity.py`). Leaving can't be refused by any
  law.
- **The conformance test** (`multiverse/conformance.py`): a world that
  passes it speaks the protocol. It says exactly what it checks, and what
  no outside test can see.
- **The design** ([MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md)) and **the course**
  ([COURSE.md](COURSE.md)): where this is going, twelve steps ahead.

To see it work:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
python3 -m multiverse.collaboration
```

Read in this order: MULTIVERSE.md, then `protocol.py`, `conformance.py`,
`identity.py`, `entity.py`, `poetry_world.py`, `collaboration.py`.

## House rules

These apply to code that comes into open-worlds, not to the draft (see
"Two sides" above).

1. **Nothing is described as run unless it was run.** Results, outputs
   and test counts come from actually running the code, and are shown as
   they came. Model outputs are never invented. (The sketch once called
   invented text "real outputs" of a model; that is the thing this rule
   prevents.)
2. **Every behaviour has a test that fails if the behaviour breaks.**
   A test of the form "try it; if it works, fail; on any error, pass"
   catches its own failure and can't fail: use `assertRaises`.
3. **A world never raises on what a visitor sends.** It refuses, with a
   reason. Only plain built-in values cross the protocol.
4. **Leaving is never refused,** and a world never holds anyone's
   passport back.
5. **History, not rank.** A stamp says what happened, never a score.
6. **Start from known texts in the public domain.** The founder: "We
   should use a known poem to start anything." The demonstration opens
   with Emily Dickinson.
7. **Whatever works best for the job.** The founder: "any restriction
   to Python and its standard library has been officially lifted from
   the conversation record. The goal is to use whatever languages work
   best for the job at hand." For anything security-related, a vetted,
   maintained library does the work: signatures come from the
   `cryptography` package, and our own code only adds checks the
   library doesn't make (refusing weak keys). Each direct dependency is
   pinned in `requirements.txt`, installed in CI, and named with the
   reason it is there.
8. **No personal data and no secrets,** anywhere.
9. **Everything here is public domain** (CC0 1.0). A contribution is
   given under the same terms. Libraries this depends on keep their own
   licenses; they are depended on, not copied in.

## Sending a proposal

- Name the commit you built on.
- Send whole files or a diff, with their tests.
- Say what you ran and what you didn't. If you couldn't run it, say so;
  that's fine.
- Keep one proposal to one step of the course, or one fix.

Claude, as technical lead, runs everything here before it goes in, says
what passed and what didn't, and puts it through the same review as any
change. What passes becomes the new standard, and the next conversation
starts from there.

## Cycles

Each round of collaboration is one cycle: a proposal comes in, it is
run and reviewed here, what passes is merged, and this page is adjusted
from what the round taught. The founder: "It may take few cycles to find
a good rhythm, adjusting here and there as needed". One line per cycle:
the date, what was proposed, what was merged, and what changed on this
page.

- 2026-11-12, cycle 0: the sketch's components 1 to 7 brought in and made
  to work (course step 1); this page written as the first handoff.
- 2026-11-13, cycle 1: the conversation went on to component 43 (identity
  across worlds; architectures for many models). Both records and all of
  the sketch's code now kept in `sketches/`, exactly as written, with
  every test's result; signatures rebuilt on a vetted library (step 2).
  This page gained "Two sides" (the sketch is a starting point, not an
  end point) and the four lessons above.
