# Building on this: start here

For anyone building on open-worlds, and in particular for the founder's
conversations with DeepSeek. This is the page to start from. The
founder: "What you put in the repo becomes the new standard we develop
from in my DeepSeek conversations."

The multiverse began as a sketch the founder wrote with DeepSeek
(conversation records 012-04-00 and 012-03-02). This repository brought
it in, made it run, and changed what needed changing; what was kept and
what changed, and why, is in [MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md) and in each
module's docstring.

## Two sides: the sketch and the standard

**The sketch is a rough draft.** Each step in the conversation assumes the
last one ran as expected and asks what to build next, the way a creative
team might convey a vision in code instead of boxes and arrows. Nobody
expects it to run, and bugs are part of a draft. In the founder's words
(to the technical lead, 2026-11-13): "it is meant to be a starting point
for you, not an end point." So an
"Expected output" in the conversation is a prediction, which is fine; the
house rules below apply when code comes into open-worlds itself.

**The records and the sketch's code are kept, apart.** They live in
[`sketches/`](../sketches/README.md): the conversation records verbatim,
and DeepSeek's code written out exactly as the record has it, with every
test's result. That is a record of DeepSeek's suggestions, kept so they
can be read, run and debugged, without committing to using them.
[`sketches/INDEX.md`](../sketches/INDEX.md) is the one place that says
where the sketch and the course meet: each component, how its tests fare,
which course step it relates to, and whether any of it is in open-worlds.

**The standard is open-worlds' own code, not the sketches.** Build on
`multiverse/` and the documents in `docs/`. The code in `sketches/` is
earlier work, some of it on the old, unsigned protocol, kept for its
ideas.

## Where the conversation stands

Record 012-04-00 is complete: components 1 to 63, ending with DeepSeek
proposing component 64, a specification for a first live federation. The
next conversation starts a new record, which gets its own folder in
`sketches/`. Each component's place is in
[`sketches/INDEX.md`](../sketches/INDEX.md). In short: components 1 to 7
are in `multiverse/`, working (course step 1); 13 and 14, signatures and
their conformance test, were rebuilt in step 2, where an identity is its
key; 15, signed passports, in step 3, where a world is a key too.

Since the sketch, the founder has added ideas that now shape the
course: learning agents in the chemistry world whose intelligence grows
with the complexity of the molecules, evolution as a path between worlds,
accelerated time, and one day a main community world
([MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md)). Then, in components 36 to 43: identity
across worlds (a person above their world-level identities, lineage,
forks and merges), and architectures for many models across worlds (the
octopus, the nervous system, the swarm, and in components 44 to 52 the
council and four more), with the founder's aim for the infrastructure:
"we just need to create infrastructure that can handle what we cannot
imagine yet." Then, in components 55 to 63: a curator for each world, an
AI that speaks for its world and proposes its development but doesn't
decide it; contracts between worlds; and, from the founder's idea of a
public ledger, a shared log of commitments that anyone can check
offline. And the founder's idea of a free tier and a paid tier, which
belongs to how open-worlds is hosted, not to the protocol, so that anyone
can always join.

## What the last stretch taught

Four lessons from components 21 to 43, for when these ideas are built
here. They are about the design, not about bugs in the draft.

1. **Anything that says something about someone needs that someone's
   signature.** In the draft, a parent can name a child without the
   child agreeing, and a third party can withdraw someone else's witness.
   In open-worlds, nobody else can make you leave, and the same should
   hold for claims about you.
2. **A self spread across worlds needs each part linked to it, with both
   signing.** The person signs "this identity is mine" and the identity
   signs "I belong to this person". That link is what makes the arms of
   the octopus one creature's arms.
3. **A person's list of identities should be a chain, like a world's
   log,** each version naming the one before, so that dropping an
   identity shows.
4. **What a part produced belongs in what it signs,** so the record shows
   what it did, not only that it reported.

## What would help most now

The code standard is kept here, step by step. The most useful
contributions now are creative and design work for the steps ahead, as
text or as code with tests:

- **Laws for new worlds.** The organic chemistry world (course step 9):
  what it admits by, what can happen in it, what counts as solving a
  problem there.
- **Problems for the learner** (course step 7): standing problems in the
  chemistry world, from easy to hard, each checkable by the chemistry
  itself.
- **Forms for the poetry world.** For example, a world whose law asks
  each turn to add a quatrain in common meter, Dickinson's meter.
- **The world kernel in Rust,** built from `rust/` to the standards in
  "Code in Rust" below.
- **Anything on the course,** proposed as described below.

## The standard

- **The code in `multiverse/`, at a named commit.** Whatever is merged
  into `main` is the current standard; a proposal names the commit it
  built on.
- **The protocol, WCP/0.4** (`multiverse/protocol.py`): manifest,
  petition, act, leave, log. An individual is a key, and every request
  is signed, for one world's id and key (`multiverse/identity.py`). A
  world is a key too: it signs its manifest, and the stamps in a
  passport, which anyone can check offline (`multiverse/passport.py`).
  A key can be saved encrypted (`multiverse/keys.py`), and signed over
  to a new one by both keys (`multiverse/succession.py`). Leaving can't
  be refused by any law.
- **The conformance test** (`multiverse/conformance.py`): a world that
  passes it speaks the protocol. It says exactly what it checks, and what
  no outside test can see.
- **The design** ([MULTIVERSE.md](MULTIVERSE.md)) and **the course**
  ([COURSE.md](COURSE.md)): where this is going, twelve steps ahead.

To see it work:

```
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -t .
python3 -m multiverse.collaboration
python3 -m multiverse.journey
```

Read in this order: MULTIVERSE.md, then `protocol.py`, `conformance.py`,
`identity.py`, `passport.py`, `entity.py`, `poetry_world.py`,
`collaboration.py`.

## House rules

These apply to code that comes into open-worlds, not to the draft (see
"Two sides" above).

1. **Nothing is described as run unless it was run.** Results, outputs
   and test counts come from actually running the code, and are shown as
   they came. Model outputs are never invented. (The sketch once called
   invented text "real outputs" of a model; that is the thing this rule
   prevents.)
2. **Every behaviour has a test that fails if the behaviour breaks.**
   A test of the form "try it; if it works, fail; on any error, pass"
   catches its own failure and can't fail: use `assertRaises`.
3. **A world never raises on what a visitor sends.** It refuses, with a
   reason. Only plain built-in values cross the protocol.
4. **Leaving is never refused,** and a world never holds anyone's
   passport back.
5. **History, not rank.** A stamp says what happened, never a score.
6. **Start from known texts in the public domain.** The founder: "We
   should use a known poem to start anything." The demonstration opens
   with Emily Dickinson.
7. **Whatever works best for the job.** The founder: "any restriction
   to Python and its standard library has been officially lifted from
   the conversation record. The goal is to use whatever languages work
   best for the job at hand." For anything security-related, a vetted,
   maintained library does the work: signatures come from the
   `cryptography` package, and our own code only adds checks the
   library doesn't make (refusing weak keys). Each direct dependency is
   pinned in `requirements.txt`, installed in CI, and named with the
   reason it is there.
8. **No personal data and no secrets,** anywhere.
9. **Everything here is public domain** (CC0 1.0). A contribution is
   given under the same terms. Libraries this depends on keep their own
   licenses; they are depended on, not copied in.

## Code in Rust

The worlds themselves are to be built in Rust. The founder: "we should
stick with Rust", with "an interface to Unity built worlds", so that
worlds made with Unity or Unreal can join, while no one owns the
foundation. The Python in `world/` and `multiverse/` stays as the
reference: the Rust code is checked against it, hash for hash.

**Start from `rust/`** ([rust/README.md](../rust/README.md)). It's a
Cargo workspace with one crate so far, `world-log`, which checks a
world's public record exactly as the Python kernel writes it. Its tests
read shared test vectors ([vectors/](../vectors/README.md)) written by
the Python kernel, so a change on either side that breaks the agreement
fails a test. Build the next pieces beside it, the same way. The first is
the world kernel itself: the rules of `world/core.py`, writing the same
log for the same seed and the same actions.

To check a draft:

```
cd rust
cargo fmt --check
cargo clippy --all-targets --locked -- -D warnings
cargo test --locked
```

These hold for every Rust file that comes in, on top of the house rules:

1. **Stable Rust, pinned.** The toolchain is named in
   `rust/rust-toolchain.toml` (1.97.0, edition 2024). No nightly
   features.
2. **Formatted, linted and tested.** The three commands above pass, and
   CI runs them. The lints are set once, in `rust/Cargo.toml`, for every
   crate; a crate doesn't loosen them.
3. **No `unsafe`.** It is forbidden. The one exception planned is the
   bridge to Unity and Unreal, which needs a C interface: it will be a
   crate of its own, with each `unsafe` block explained and tested.
4. **Never panic on what comes from outside** (house rule 3). Anything
   read from a file, the network or a visitor is checked by code that
   returns a `Result` with a reason. `unwrap`, `expect`, `panic!` and
   indexing with `[]` are refused by the lints. Tests may use them, and
   say so at their top.
5. **The same in, the same out.** A world given the same seed and the
   same actions writes the same log, on any machine. Inside a world: no
   clock (time is the tick); no randomness but a seeded generator the
   world owns; no order that can change between runs (`BTreeMap`, not
   `HashMap`, for anything written, hashed or signed); and no floating
   point in anything hashed or signed.
6. **The same bytes as Python.** Anything hashed or signed is written
   exactly as the Python reference writes it, and shared test vectors
   prove it. A new kind of record brings its vectors, written by the
   Python side (`world/vectors.py`), with tests on both sides.
7. **Few dependencies, all free.** Each is named once in
   `rust/Cargo.toml` with the reason it's there. `Cargo.lock` is
   committed and CI builds with `--locked`, so no version moves
   unnoticed. Licences must let anyone use the code freely: MIT,
   Apache-2.0, BSD, zlib, Unlicense or CC0. Nothing under the GPL, and
   nothing closed. Cryptography always comes from a vetted crate
   (SHA-256 from `sha2`; for signatures, `ed25519-dalek` is the likely
   choice), never written by hand.
8. **Every public item documented** (`missing_docs` is on), and each
   crate says what it doesn't do yet, under "Limits".
9. **Public domain**, like everything here: each crate says
   `license = "CC0-1.0"`.

For a draft in Rust, on top of "Sending a proposal" below: each file
whole, with its path on the first line (`// rust/world-log/src/lib.rs`);
only the crates already in the workspace, unless the draft names a new
one and says why; and whether it was compiled. A draft that wasn't
compiled is welcome: Claude compiles it, and says what passed and what
didn't.

## Sending a proposal

- **Start each new conversation from this page.** Its link first, so the
  draft builds on what is here now.
- Name the commit you built on.
- **Give every file whole, with its file name on the first line** (as a
  comment or the start of its docstring), demonstrations and small
  additions included. A block that says "add this after the module" can't
  run until someone attaches it: in record 012-04-00, eighteen test files
  couldn't load for that reason alone.
- Send whole files or a diff, with their tests.
- Say what you ran and what you didn't. If you couldn't run it, say so;
  that's fine.
- Keep one proposal to one step of the course, or one fix.

Claude, as technical lead, runs everything here before it goes in, says
what passed and what didn't, and puts it through the same review as any
change. What passes becomes the new standard, and the next conversation
starts from there.

## Cycles

Each round of collaboration is one cycle: a proposal comes in, it is
run and reviewed here, what passes is merged, and this page is adjusted
from what the round taught. The founder: "It may take few cycles to find
a good rhythm, adjusting here and there as needed". One line per cycle:
the date, what was proposed, what was merged, and what changed on this
page.

- 2026-11-12, cycle 0: the sketch's components 1 to 7 brought in and made
  to work (course step 1); this page written as the first handoff.
- 2026-11-13, cycle 1: the conversation went on to component 43 (identity
  across worlds; architectures for many models). Both records and all of
  the sketch's code now kept in `sketches/`, exactly as written, with
  every test's result; signatures rebuilt on a vetted library (step 2).
  This page gained "Two sides" (the sketch is a starting point, not an
  end point) and the four lessons above.
- 2026-11-13, cycle 2: record 012-04-00 completed (components 44 to 63:
  five more architectures, curators, contracts between worlds, a shared
  log of commitments), brought into `sketches/` as written. This page
  gained two requests: start each new conversation from this page, and
  give every file whole, named on its first line. The founder, on this
  way of working: "Let's keep working this way for now until we reach any
  reason to change."
